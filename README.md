# PoolSafe
#### The Raspberry Pi lifeguarding assistant

This project leverages OpenCV and Python, as well as a drowning detection model to monitor a space and determine whether or not there is someone drowning.
By connecting a camera to a Raspberry Pi, we can identify possible drowning accidents as they happen and send a message to the pool owner to alert them.

It is also possible to set up a buzzer system for the Raspberry Pi, however I opted for the text messages to reduce cost.
